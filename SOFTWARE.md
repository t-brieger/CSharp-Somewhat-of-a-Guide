#Useful Software
##IDEs
####[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com)
(I recommend 2015 or 2017, but most versions are fine. Don't confuse it with Visual Studio Code though, that's just a plain text editor)

**Positives:**

-Probably most Advanced C# IDE at the moment&#10;&#13;-Integration with GitHub&#10;&#13;-Support for more Languages (for example Visual Basic, Visual C++, etc.)&#10;&#13;-Extensive Add-on Support &#10;&#13;-Integrated GUI Editor

**Negatives:**

-Not Open-Source&#10;&#13;-Free Microsoft account required after 30 days (not *technically* required, but it keeps giving annoying pop-ups)&#10;&#13;-Only for Windows

#### [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx)

(Download button is on the top bar)

**Positives:**

-Open-Source&#10;&#13;-Support for More Languages (for example Visual Basic, XML, etc.)&#10;&#13;-Completely Free and no registration required&#10;&#13;-Existing Add-on Support (although there aren't many add-ons available)&#10;&#13;-integrated GUI Editor&#10;&#13;-Portable Version Exists&#10;&#13;-Very leightweight

**Negatives:**

-A little Outdated in some Aspects&#10;&#13;-No (built in) GitHub support&#10;&#13;-Only for Windows

-Open-Source&#10;&#13;-Support for More Languages (for example Java, C, etc.)&#10;&#13;-Multi-Platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows)&#10;&#13;-Add-On Support&#10;&#13;-GitHub Support

**Negatives:**

-No Built-in GUI Editor&#10;&#13;-Is Limited by the Bugs that Mono itself still has&#10;&#13;-Syntax Highlighting sometimes faulty

##Websites
I know this is technically not software, but I didn't want to make another category just for Websites

#### [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/)

**Positives**

-Made by the company that created C# so it's well written, detailed and up to date

**Negatives**

-Sometimes it can be *too* detailed and just confuse you
