#How to run your code
##By Compiling it with in an IDE
In most IDEs, the key `f5` compiles and runs your code. If not, there's usually a button (often along the top of the window) called something like `run`.

If neither of these is true for your IDE of choice or you can't find it, you can probably find how to run your code by searching for `<IDE> run code` on the web.

##By Compiling it online
There are a multitude of webapps that allow you to compile C# code online and even run it in your browser. those, of course, can not replace a proper IDE / runnable file when it comes to things like creating windows or doing complex math-y equations, but they are a quick alternative if you don't want to boot up your IDE just for a small project.
